# CICIDSIMG
Dataset about Network Time Series Forecasting

This dataset is generated using TKAN, which demonstrates strong forecasting capabilities on network time series data. It consists of RGB images categorized into ten types, derived from the [CICIDS2017 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html). We believe it will significantly enhance the performance of network intrusion prediction tasks and network time series data prediction. Welcome to use our dataset!

To use out dataset, please clone this repository and run split.py in your Python environment. The images corresponding to the ten attack types will be extracted into their respective folders.
+ *dataset/extracted/test/*
+ *dataset/extracted/train/*
+ *dataset/extracted/val/*
  
After that, you can run your model, and evaluate its performance on our dataset!
